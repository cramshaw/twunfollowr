# twunfollowr

A short program designed to help build Twitter followings.

Enter the username or id of a user who has followers you'd like to target.

Run the program.

Number of users to follow at one time can be altered, as can number of days to wait before an unfollow.

Set your Twitter API keys as environment variables in a file called export-keys.

Something like this:

export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="xx-yy"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="xx-yy"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="xx-yy"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="xx-yy"
